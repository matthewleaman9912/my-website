            <p>My name is Matthew Leaman and I am a 24 year old from Columbus, Ohio. I recently graduated from THE Ohio State University with a Bachelor's Degree in theoretical mathematics. I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, Avery, and my dog, Arlo, in my free time. I also enjoy rubrik's cubes, video games, and good food. I am excited to learn and grow in this class.</p>
